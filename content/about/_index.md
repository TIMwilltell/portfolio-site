I’m Timothy—a Product Manager who’s spent more time in Confluence than most people spend in traffic. I believe in building products (and documentation) that people actually use, not just admire from a safe distance.

I specialize in turning chaos into clarity, ambiguity into action, and coffee into features. My approach is pragmatic: keep it simple, keep it useful, and keep it just irreverent enough to stay awake during sprint planning.

When I’m not wrangling teams or updating the internal wiki, you’ll find me brewing more coffee, raising two kids, experimenting in the kitchen, or tinkering with my homelab.

If you’re here for product insights, practical advice, coffee brewing tips, or just to see if I’ll make another Confluence joke, you’re in the right place. Want to debate mulching versus ejecting grass clippings, or argue about the best way to write acceptance criteria? [Let’s connect!](mailto:timothy@thedailyclark.com)
