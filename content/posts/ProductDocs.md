# Nobody Will Ever Read the Manual

We’ve all wasted hours on 50-page specs that nobody opens. Here are some principles to help you write documentation that matters.

## Why Agile Documentation Matters

I’ve worked at enough companies to know every manager has their own sacred documentation ritual. Some want a novella, others a haiku. Either way, you spend hours researching and producing the document they asked for, only for the Confluence viewer count to stay stuck at one. The problem with this traditional approach to “alignment” is that it’s rooted in a deep, unspoken distrust of product teams. If you can’t trust your team to make decisions, you can always trust them to waste time on paperwork.

One former manager was obsessed with Marty Cagan, but never actually let product teams own decisions. They talked a big game about building missionaries, but in practice, we were just well-dressed mercenaries with a Google Doc addiction. True missionaries have passion and belief. They just do it, and leadership trusts them and provides the tools needed for success.

Documentation should serve this mission and be part of the agile, iterative process. The docs one product team produces don’t have to look like the docs from another team. Documentation should evolve with the team. It’s about delivering value to the customer. Sometimes, the “customer” is a developer, or marketing, or management, or, on a wild day, an actual customer.

## The Pragmatic Approach to Agile Documentation

So, how do we actually do this? Let’s break it down into some guiding principles.

### Keep It Lean

The key to agile documentation is to keep it simple. Don’t try to write a novel. Focus on the essentials. What does your reader actually need to know? What problem are they trying to solve?

If the problem is complex or not fully understood, capture the core of the issue. Then, through discussion, analysis, and research, start to unravel and simplify what’s being solved. This forms your foundation for functional and non-functional requirements. From here, user stories can be told and acceptance criteria defined.

During this process, remember to stick to the point. Resist the urge to wander into the shadow-haunted recesses of the soul where every thought flourishes into a labyrinthine tapestry. You are not Faulkner, and your readers are not here for a literary journey through guilt, desire, and decay. Stay focused. Channel your inner Hemingway. Use clear, strong words. Simplicity wins.

### Make It a Team Effort

Most people would rather clean out the office fridge than write documentation. But if you want docs that are actually useful, you need to get everyone involved. Assign documentation as part of the sprint or research spikes, not as an afterthought. Everyone should be spending time generating documentation as part of research spikes, specs, test cases, technical guides, etc. Make it collaborative. If you can get people to write together, you’ll get better docs and, as a bonus, a little team bonding. The real pay-off is when they get to see a document they helped write save the day, or at least save them the hassle of having to join a meeting full of middle-management.

### Write It for the Reader

I have a habit of writing for myself. Years of writing things nobody reads will do that to you. But I found that writing for myself also meant I was writing like I spoke. I spend more time writing than most people probably do, because writing helps me better understand a subject. It forces me to process and distill information into a more easily, coherent format.

Use plain language. Ditch the corporate buzzwords and technical jargon. If you wouldn’t say it in a bar, don’t put it in your doc. Provide context. Don’t assume your reader knows the backstory. A little context goes a long way. Explain the “why” before the “what.” And for the love of all that is holy, include examples. Nothing beats a good example. Show, don’t just tell. Screenshots, diagrams, sample data, whatever helps your reader “get it” faster.

If you can make someone laugh while explaining a complex concept, congratulations. You’ve won documentation. Most humor I insert into my writing is to keep things interesting for myself. It makes me smile, and if it makes someone else smile then that's just a bonus. You don't have to be funny. Forced humor is almost as bad as an LLM attempting stand-up. I will offer a word of warning. I was asked if a document I had could be shared externally with a vendor. This particular document, I recalled, was riddled with Star Trek: Next Generation references. I had to ask for some time to make sure there wasn't any "sensitive company information" included in the document.

### Update It Regularly

Documentation is not a set-it-and-forget-it kind of thing. It needs regular maintenance to stay relevant. Otherwise, it’s just another fossil in the Confluence tar pit.

Schedule regular reviews. Put it on the calendar. If it’s not scheduled, it won’t happen. Get feedback. Ask your team what’s missing or unclear. If nobody complains, they’re not reading it. Archive outdated content. Don’t let old docs linger. If it’s obsolete, move it to the archive. Or, if you’re feeling dramatic, delete it in a blaze of glory. Make documentation part of the process. Treat it like writing unit tests. If it’s not documented, it’s not **done**.

## The Bottom Line

Nobody will ever read the manual. But they might need to refer to a section of it once in a while. When someone finally asks how something works, and you gleefully send them a link to a detailed, up-to-date guide, you’ll start to win trust in your internal wiki. Agile documentation is not about checking a box or appeasing management. It’s about creating living, breathing guides that help your team (and future-you) build better products, faster.

Keep it lean. Make it collaborative. Write for real humans. Keep it fresh. Your team and your future self will thank you. Or at least, they’ll stop sending you Slack messages at 4:59 PM on a Friday.

Now go forth and document. But, you know, only the important stuff.
